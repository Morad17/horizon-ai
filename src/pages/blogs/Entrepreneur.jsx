          Working with young entrepreneurs, Horizon has experience developing
          individuals with and without degrees. Both have achieved great success
          in the fast-developing market. In a recent interview, Horizon Managing

        <p className="text-content">
          “At Horizon, we make decisions on growth mindset and personality, over
          a specific skill set. By integrating candidates into our company
          culture, we can develop a healthy business built on quality and
          integrity. Someone who can demonstrate an open mind and a passion for
          learning can go a whole lot further than someone with a host of
          qualifications and a 'know-it-all' attitude.”

          Horizon urges people to be creative when sharing experiences that
          highlight marketable skills. 'Graduates should share details on
          projects which spotlight writing skills, leadership qualities or the
          ability to achieve consistent results.'

        <p className="text-content">
          Despite living in the age of technology, a real face-to-face authentic
          connection is getting more and more difficult to come by. It is
          important to make a great first impression. By being genuine, you will
          highlight your natural positivity and open-mindedness. Making an
          impression doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be extroverted,
          constantly lauded, or never alone. Instead, what is meant by being the
          person everyone wants to be around is that, in your presence, people
          relax, feel safe, and know that you are on their side. Happiness is
          contagious, and at Horizon, a happy workplace is a productive
          workplace.
